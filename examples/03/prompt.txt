The wind howls like a living thing atop the Wall, tearing at cloak and breath alike. Frost-bitten reins shudder in blue-gloved hands, leather singing under the strain as the mount surges forward. Rime needles the air; every gust stings, every exhale turns to smoke.
Ahead, the Wall rises—an ancient, merciless spine of ice—its face etched with a thousand winters. As the rider climbs, the world beyond unfurls in stark grandeur: frozen waterfalls suspended mid-fall, pale as glass; shattered icefields drifting like islands in a white void. Black stone keeps loom closer, their gothic lines emerging from the storm, torchlight flickering like wary eyes.
The Wall does not welcome. It watches. And still the rider presses on, carried by wind and oath into the cold, where legends are written in frost.
